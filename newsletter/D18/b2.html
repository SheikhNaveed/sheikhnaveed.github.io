                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">How would you describe your job?</h4>
                <p class=" ">My specific role is to strategize with the tour operators and wholesalers to help them increase their Virtuoso production. A big piece of the puzzle is collaborating with them on their annual and sometimes multi-year Virtuoso business plans, but on a daily basis I help them navigate their way through all of the new and existing initiatives to determine which ones are best for them.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">What's a good analogy for what you do?</h4>
                <p class=" ">I like to say that Virtuoso is the Major League Baseball of travel. We may not own the products but we govern myriad ways in which our partners interact with our members.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">What do you enjoy most about your job?</h4>
                <p class=" ">I love working for an innovative company that remains a leader in a changing industry, and I love working on the D&amp;E team because it’s truly a supportive, collaborative group of people.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">The biggest change I've experienced at Virtuoso was...</h4>
				<p class=" ">moving over to the Destinations & Experiences team after 10 years on the Hotel team.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">How were you able to embrace that change?</h4>
				<p class=" ">It was fun to dig into the tour operators with their niche products, like Micato, Rocky Mountaineer, and Butterfield &amp; Robinson. The wholesalers, though, are a completely different animal. They’re like onions &mdash; every time I think I know all there is to know about them, I uncover another layer that surprises or stumps me, so maintaining regular calls with those accounts is paramount.

				<p class=" ">Gilda Radner as Young Daniela &mdash; her crazy hair always looked like mine as a kid!
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">The last book I read (and enjoyed) was:</h4>
