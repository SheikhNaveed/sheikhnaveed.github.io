                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">The best analogy for what I do:</h4>
                <p class=" ">Writing code is like changing the oil on your car, only you didn‚Äôt notice your hands are covered with a corrosive, fast-acting, metal-eating chemical that rubs against the front axle, which in-turn during the test drive on the freeway caused the axel to collapse spectacularly, with both front wheels ejecting to either side. üòä
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">What I enjoy most about my job:</h4>
                <p class=" ">Like many at Virtuoso, I enjoy the people. A healthy, fun culture is something that takes years to cultivate. In January 2019, I officially changed roles from BI team engineer / lead to Kali team engineer / lead. Kali team is full of extremely talented and strong engineers. I am very thankful to be a part of this team and we are already thriving, solving problems together.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">What makes Virtuoso different than other jobs you‚Äôve worked?</h4>
                <p class=" ">I worked at Microsoft, IBM, Adobe, and Virtuoso. Reviewing that list, the obvious difference is company size. The people at Virtuoso are real, unique, fun, hardworking, and come from interesting backgrounds. With large organizations, one can get lost in the numbers. At Virtuoso, I have seen talented people come and go over the years. The biggest thing people struggle with when moving on to other opportunities is leaving behind their friends.
