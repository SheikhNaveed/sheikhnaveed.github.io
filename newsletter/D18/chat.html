                        It’s been three months since you led 209 Virtuoso employees through the Myers Briggs Type

                        Gae: The MBTI shows us the different ways people see and understand the world. The most
                        important point is that a team, an organization, in fact, the world needs all eight approaches
                        to be successful and all eight need to be respected for the unique value each brings to the
                        table.

                        When I facilitate Myers Briggs workshops around the world, I find that we humans are more alike
                        than we are different. Under the surface veneer of our cultures, we share many of the same
                        psychological needs. For example, in order to learn new processes, solve problems and become
                        energized, people who prefer Introversion typically need silence, solitude, and time for
                        reflection &mdash; regardless of their country of origin. Whereas someone who prefers
                        Extraversion typically needs interaction, dialogue, and discussion &mdash; again, regardless of
                        their country of origin. The MBTI, therefore, is a great tool for building bridges of
                        understanding across cultures and countries.

                    <p class="p-left ">
                        So, to call back to how you opened our workshops, some of the behavioral differences people may
                        attribute to culture, might actually be rooted in MBTI?

                        Possibly. People are a complex combination of environmental influences, cultural influences,
                        philosophical beliefs, familial teachings, and personality preferences. My suggestion would be
                        to get to know people as individuals and not to stereotype them based on culture or country or
                        MBTI letters!
