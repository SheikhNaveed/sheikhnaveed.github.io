                        <h4 class="mediumHeading">It’s been three months since you led 209 Virtuoso employees through
                            the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). What’s the most important point you’d want to
                            reinforce with them?</h4>

                        <p class="mediumText mb50">Gae: The MBTI shows us the different ways people see and understand
                            the world. The most important point is that a team, an organization, in fact, the world
                            needs all eight approaches to be successful and all eight need to be respected for the
                            unique value each brings to the table.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mediumHeading">As Virtuoso opens offices in new corners of the world, are there any
                            MBTI-based words of wisdom you can offer us as we evolve from our US-headquartered roots to
                            a multicultural global organization?</h4>

                        <p class="mediumText mb50">When I facilitate Myers Briggs workshops around the world, I find
                            that we humans are more alike than we are different. Under the surface veneer of our
                            cultures, we share many of the same psychological needs. For example, in order to learn new
                            processes, solve problems and become energized, people who prefer Introversion typically
                            need silence, solitude, and time for reflection — regardless of their country of origin.
                            Whereas someone who prefers Extraversion typically needs interaction, dialogue, and
                            discussion — again, regardless of their country of origin. The MBTI, therefore, is a great
                            tool for building bridges of understanding across cultures and countries.</p>

                        <h4 class="mediumHeading">So, to call back to how you opened our workshops, some of the
                            behavioral differences people may
                            attribute to culture, might actually be rooted in MBTI?</h4>

                        <p class="mediumText mb50">Possibly. People are a complex combination of environmental
                            influences, cultural influences,
                            philosophical beliefs, familial teachings, and personality preferences. My suggestion would
                            be
                            to get to know people as individuals and not to stereotype them based on culture or country
                            or
                            MBTI letters!</p>

                        <h4 class="mediumHeading">What’s the most common mistake that people make about MBTI? Especially
                            those who may have taken
                            an “unofficial” version on some random website?</h4>

                        <p class="mediumText mb50">The most common mistake people make is based on the misperception
                            that the MBTI labels people
                            and that once you know someone's four "letters" you can predict behavior. That's why the
                            MBTI
                            emphasizes the word "preference." While I may prefer Introversion, I can also access my
                            Extraversion and behave in an extraverted manner if I choose to. Likewise, while I may
                            prefer to
                            make decisions using my preference for Thinking, I can consciously choose to override my
                            Thinking decision and utilize my Feeling function. On each of the four MBTI scales we have
                            both
                            functions available to us and can switch back and forth even though we usually prefer one
                            over
                            the other.</p>

                        <h4 class="mediumHeading">Matthew has long stressed the importance of being a lifelong learner,
                            and you definitely fit
                            that description. Is that in any way related to your MBTI preferences?</h4>

                        <p class="mediumText mb50">Gae: The desire to learn resides in all the types — however, the
                            topics in which people are
                            interested often differ and how they learn best is type dependent. Sensors typically want to
                            learn practical "how to" things like how to build an aquarium or how to build a strong
                            retirement portfolio. Intuitives typically want to explore cutting edge topics, innovative
                            approaches that have never been tried before.<br>
                            <br>
                            Thinkers become lifelong learners to achieve mastery and increase competency. Feelers become
                            lifelong learners to discover ways to help people.<br>
                            <br>
                            How people learn best is related to Extraversion and Introversion. Discussion and dialogue
                            seem
                            to work best for the Extravert while reading and reflecting seem to work best for the
                            Introvert.</p>
