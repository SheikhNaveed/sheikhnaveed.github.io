Culturally, it has everything you want from a big city, with walkable neighborhoods and a more laid-back West Coast attitude, but with the mountains or coast right there for weekend adventures. Bonus points for seemingly endless summer days with no humidity.</p>

The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History is always fun for kiddos and it has the original IMAX/Omni movie theater and the Noble Planetarium. The Kimbell Art Museum is in the same area and there are some great restaurants nearby. The West 7th area and the Stockyards are close, too, if you don’t feel like a museum.</p>

The really cool thing: It’s also the headquarters for indie-hero KEXP radio station, which frequently hosts free live performances in the space. There’s a window into the DJ booth, roll-up garage doors for nice summer and fall days, comfy seating, and an on-site record store from Light in the Attic Records. It’s the epitome of everything that originally appealed to me about Seattle, hidden just out of view of one of its busiest tourist traps.</p>

It’s in the Stockyards and is still run by the same family that started it. The actual restaurant was originally the family house and the fountain in the middle of the patio used to be the kids pool while the adults served the food. They don’t even have a menu. The servers just tell you they have enchiladas or fajitas as entrees. But the margaritas are better than the food, I think. To me, it feels like a hideaway in the Stockyards.

                                        <p class="custom-text-color-2">KVW: There are a few ways to spot a native: we are loud and like to show off, the word “che” will reveal a native (It´s like saying “hey you,” like Hey you, what do you think if this? Hey you, would you like to go and have dinner?), we also tend to use the word “viste” (did you notice/see) at the end of many phrases. Soccer (we call it football) will come up in almost every male conversation and women are recognized for good taste in fashion.</p>

If someone uses “Y'all” or “fixin'” correctly, you know they are a native. If you see someone in a cowboy hat, boots and jeans, they are usually a native &mdash; transplants can’t pull off all three. It’s not a visual thing.</p>
