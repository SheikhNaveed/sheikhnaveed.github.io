                <p class=" ">Being able to spend someone else’s money!
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">My favorite Virtuoso memory:</h4>
                <p class=" ">Going to my first Travel Mart, now VTW &mdash; and oh, how it’s changed!  Very exciting to see how the membership works and the collaboration going on.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">The biggest change I’ve experienced at Virtuoso was:</h4>
                <p class=" ">It’s been a lot of change. I started working for Percival Tours in Accounting when we were in the Tandy Center in downtown Fort Worth. Then I moved over to Upchurch Travel and became a travel agent dedicated to the Alcon account. I moved back to API/Virtuoso in our first office on Main Street where we were spread out over six floors; after two moves, it’s nice that we’re all on one floor.

			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">My comfort food:</h4>
				<p class=" ">Mexican food. Any kind of enchiladas, medium to spicy.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Food or drink I really can’t stand:</h4>
				<p class=" ">I’m not a fan of curry.
				</p>
			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Favorite drink:</h4>
				<p class=" ">Mambo taxi from Mi Cocina – it’s like a sangria margarita… but you should only drink one.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Favorite snack:</h4>
				<p class=" ">Chips and guac, and cashews.
				</p>
			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Favorite actor:</h4>
				<p class=" ">Goldie Hawn/Sandra Bullock
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Favorite singer/band:</h4>
				<p class=" ">George Strait! (Is there anyone else?) I love his song, “Clear Blue Sky.”
				</p>
			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">I grew up in:</h4>
				<p class=" ">Weatherford, Texas. I moved there from Monahans, Texas when I was four, and the city has grown quite a bit since then. It’s a great place to watch cutting horse futurity.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">Pet peeve:</h4>
				<p class=" ">When people don’t put things back from where they belong
				</p>
			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">When I want to relax, I…</h4>
				<p class=" ">sit on my front porch with a cup of coffee
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">When I’m not working I like to…</h4>
				<p class=" ">Travel, of course.  I’d like to go back to London – two days was not enough. And Australia is near the top of my bucket list.
				</p>
			    <h4 class="text-color-quaternary font-weight-extra-bold ">For fun:</h4>
				<p class=" ">We go four-wheeling in Silverton, Colorado. We’ve been going there for about 15 years. We ride our four-wheelers in the mountains, and into town to visit the shops and bars.
